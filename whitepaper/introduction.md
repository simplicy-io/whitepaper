# Introduction

An e-commerce platform is an application which acts as a trading bridge between merchants and purchasers. With the rapid development of Internet and e-commerce technology, online shopping has become an important part of people’s daily life. In recent years, the number of e-commerce online customers in various regions of the world has increased significantly. There are more than three million companies worldwide engaged in e-commerce\[1\], including Amazon, eBay, Alibaba, Bol and Walmart.

 Internet electronic payment is an indispensable part of e-commerce transactions. Customers select products from the merchant via the Internet and purchase with an electronic payment. Credit or debit cards are accepted by most e-commerce platforms. We take a MasterCard payment as an example. There are several steps that must be undertaken to complete a payment, including authorization, clearing and settlement. The processes involve a customer, an e-commerce platform, a customer’s bank, the MasterCard company or MasterCard system, a MasterCard settlement bank, a merchant’s bank, and result in nearly 20 transactions or messages being exchanged among these participants\[3\].![](https://github.com/simplicy-io/whitepaper/raw/main/Card%20Payments.png) Figure 2.
