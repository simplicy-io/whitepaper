## Abstract
The emergence of e-commerce has changed the way people trade. However, merchants are charged high fees for their use of the platform and for payment services.
These costs are passed on to customers in the form of higher prices. Using crypto-currency is quite hard to understand for average persons and crypto-currencies are also highly volatile, which are less suited to use as E-commerce, Point of Sale and P2P payments. Most Blockchain technology can provide lower transaction fees with high security and privacy levels but is incapable of delivering the number of transactions per second demanded by real e-commerce and point of sale. 
Simplicy has to solve these issues, by combining Open Bank API with Blockchain as a Blackbox. In this article, we focus on the effect that our technology can provide in reducing fee costs and improving transaction volumes. We introduce the problems that the e-commerce industry is facing currently and how blockchain technology can help to address these issues.
